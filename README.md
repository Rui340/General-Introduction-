# General-Introduction-
Welcome to Rui's personal github account.

# What does it include?
Here, you will find the refined projects that I have been working on for the past few years. The topics of those projects range from data mining, machine learning, data analysis, to my own cousre projects that are mainly focused on the research problems. 

#  Why do I create a new (this) github account rather than showing you my original account?
1) Some of those projects were initiated and completed for university's course requirements. That is being said that I am not allowed to directly share the work with you to avoid possible plagiarism. However, What I did here is that I modified some parts of the code or even applied the same framework to a different set of problems. Therefore, to maintain acedemic integrety is one of the reasons that I've created this account.  
2) Some of those projects were originally done during my intern. I could not share you with the original code or the notebooks as it contains sensitive bussiness information data. Therefore, I removed all the bussiness sensative infomation and the code that are written by my colleagues out of respect to my previous company and observance to the law. 
3) I did my internship in China. Consequently, some of codes' comments or the wording parts are completely written in Chinese. Some of the projects are great and I want to share these projects with you, so I will translated all Chinese parts to English.
4) Some of the projects are the extension of what I have been doing and thinking during the internship. Those extension came from the ideas which I did not have the chance to realize when the ideas first jumped up in my head. They were experimental,time consuming and challenging so my boss could not afford the luxary of realizing those ideas. However, You will see those ideas and how they are realized in code in my github repositories.
